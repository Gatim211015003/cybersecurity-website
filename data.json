    "types": ["Ransomware", "Trojans", "Spyware", "Worms", "Cryptojacking", "Adware"],
    "applications": "Malware is any malicious software designed to disrupt systems, damage data, or gain unauthorized access. Unlike attacks based on deception, malware must be installed or executed on a target device to achieve its objectives.  It is often used by cybercriminals to steal sensitive data, obtain banking credentials, or extort victims for financial gain. ",
    "advantages": "For attackers, malware offers high financial returns, especially with ransomware targeting large organizations.  Business models like Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) lower the technical barrier for criminals.  Malware also allows for long-term, covert access to systems for espionage or to launch further attacks. ",
    "disadvantages": "For victims, malware can lead to the loss of critical data, identity theft, and major financial damage.  The primary challenge for attackers is evading detection from evolving security software, requiring continuous investment in anti-analysis features to hide their malicious code. "

  "phishing": {
    "types": ["Email Phishing", "Spear Phishing", "CEO Fraud", "Smishing (SMS)", "Vishing (Voice)", "Pharming"],
    "applications": "Phishing is a form of social engineering that uses deceptive electronic communications to manipulate victims into revealing sensitive data or executing harmful actions.  It fundamentally targets human psychology—exploiting trust, urgency, or fear—rather than technical system flaws.  This is why the human element is considered the primary vulnerability in phishing attacks. ",
    "impacts": "Phishing is the leading cause of data breaches, initiating over 90% of successful hacks.  The consequences include identity theft, significant financial loss (with the average breach costing millions), and unauthorized access to personal or company accounts.  Because these breaches can take over 200 days to detect, attackers have ample time for data exfiltration and lateral movement within a network. "
